## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Step 1: Clone or Download
```bash
cd C:\Users\Atharva\Documents
# (Project is already in inventory_system folder)
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd inventory_system
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

### Step 4: Access the Application
Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

The application will automatically:

## 🎯 Usage Guide

### Dashboard (Home)
- View summary cards: Total Products, Total Sales, Low Stock Count, Suppliers
- See recent sales and low stock alerts

### Products Page
- Click "Add New Product" to create a product
- Edit or delete existing products
- Products automatically get inventory entries

### Suppliers Page
- Manage supplier information
- Add, edit, or delete suppliers

### Inventory Page
- View current stock levels with color-coded status:
  - 🔴 Red: Critical (< 10 units)
  - 🟡 Yellow: Low (< 20 units)
  - 🟢 Green: Healthy (≥ 20 units)
- Update stock quantities and restock dates

### Sales Page
- Record new sales transactions
- Inventory automatically decrements
- Delete sales to restore inventory

### AI Insights Page
- Click "Run AI Prediction" to analyze stock levels
- View predictions table showing:
  - Current stock
  - Predicted daily sales
  - Days until stockout
  - Confidence level
- Interactive charts:
  - Sales trend over time
  - Category sales distribution

## 🤖 AI Prediction Model

The system uses **Linear Regression** from scikit-learn to:

1. **Analyze Historical Data**: Reviews past sales for each product
2. **Predict Future Sales**: Forecasts expected daily sales
3. **Calculate Days to Stockout**: Determines when products will run out
4. **Prioritize Alerts**: Highlights critical and warning items

### Prediction Status
- ⚠️ **Critical**: Stock will run out in ≤ 3 days
- ⚠️ **Warning**: Stock will run out in ≤ 7 days
- ⚠️ **Low Stock**: Current stock < 10 units
- ✅ **Healthy**: Sufficient stock available

### Confidence Levels
- **High**: Based on 5+ sales records
- **Medium**: Based on 3-4 sales records
- **Low**: Based on < 3 sales records

## 🔧 Configuration

### Change Database (Optional)
To use MySQL instead of SQLite, update `app.py`:

```python
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'mysql://username:password@localhost/inventory_db'
```

### Adjust Port
Change the port in `app.py`:

```python
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
```

### Sample Data
The system initializes with sample data on first run. To reset:
1. Delete `inventory.db`
2. Restart the application
