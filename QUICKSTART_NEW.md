## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Address already in use"
Another app is using port 5000. Change port in app.py:
```python
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)
```

### "Template not found"
Make sure you're in the correct directory:
```bash
cd C:\Users\Atharva\Documents\inventory_system
python app.py
```

### "Module not found"
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Fresh Start
Delete database and restart:
```bash
# On Windows:
del instance\inventory.db
python app.py

# On Linux/Mac:
rm instance/inventory.db
python app.py
```
